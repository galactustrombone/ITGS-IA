			<h1>Sheet Music Management System</h1>
			<p>A PHP and MySQL based sheet music management system entirely usable within a browser. Your mileage with old browsers may vary as this website uses HTML5, so please try using a modern browser if you are having issues. Google Chrome is recommended as it has extra features such as a calendar date entry tool, and the floating searchbar works best with Firefox, however up to date versions of Edge, Opera, and Safari should also work fine.</p>
